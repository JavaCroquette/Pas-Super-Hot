# Blender to Unity

In blender:
- set to rotation to x = 90, y = 0, z = 180
- set scale to x = 100, y = 100, z = 100
- hit ctrl + a, then reinitialize "rotation & scale"
- export to fbx, select what you want (mesh/armature...), deselect camera and lamp

In Unity:
- drag and drop fbx file in project window
- select newly added object
- in transform, set rotation to 0,0,0 and scale to 1,1,1
